DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Jenkins
=========================================

1. What is Jenkins and Why it used?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used in real projects to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. 
In day-to-day work, developers continuously change code and push it to a version control system like GitHub. Manually downloading that code, building it, 
testing it, and deploying it every time is slow, error-prone, and not scalable. Jenkins solves this problem by acting as an automation engine 
that performs these steps automatically whenever a change happens.

In a real-time scenario, when a developer pushes new code to a Git repository, Jenkins detects the change (through a webhook or polling). 
It then pulls the latest code, runs the build process, executes tests, creates artifacts such as Docker images or binaries, and deploys 
the application to a test or production environment based on the pipeline rules. If something goes wrong, Jenkins immediately marks the build as failed 
and notifies the team, helping issues get fixed early instead of reaching production.

Jenkins fits into the DevOps workflow by connecting development and operations. 
It allows teams to define their entire software delivery process as code, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and faster delivery. 
In real organizations, Jenkins is often used to run CI/CD pipelines that integrate tools like Git, Docker, cloud platforms, 
and monitoring systems, enabling teams to deliver software reliably and continuously rather than through manual, one-time deployments.

Real world development scenario
-----------------------------------------

In a real software delivery process, everything starts with planning, where business and technical teams decide what features need to be built, 
how the software should behave, and how it will be delivered. Once the plan is finalized, developers begin working in the development environment, 
writing and modifying code on their local systems. This code is then pushed to a central version control system such as Git, which acts as the 
single source of truth and allows teams to track changes, collaborate, and roll back if needed.

When new code is pushed to Git, an automated build process is triggered. During this stage, the application is compiled or packaged, dependencies 
are resolved, and automated tests are executed. Jenkins or a similar CI tool monitors this process and determines whether the build succeeds or fails. 
If the build fails due to compilation errors, test failures, or configuration issues, the pipeline stops immediately and sends a notification back to the 
developer so the issue can be fixed early, before it affects other environments.

If the build succeeds, the application is automatically deployed to a test environment where functional testing, integration testing, or user 
acceptance testing can take place. This environment closely resembles production but is safe for validation. If issues are detected at this stage, 
the deployment is halted and feedback is sent to the development team. Once the application passes all required checks and approvals in the test environment, 
it is then promoted to the production environment, where it becomes available to end users. This controlled, automated flow ensures that only stable and verified 
code reaches production, reducing risk and enabling faster, more reliable software delivery in real-world systems.
