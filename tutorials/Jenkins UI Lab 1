Jenkins Lab 1
===========================================

1. username option: where can configure admin or default account.

2. UI Definitions:
  a. On the left panel, the first section runs from New Item to Views, serving as the configuration area that can be extended by installing plugins. 
  b. The second section shows the build queue and job execution status, which helps track ongoing and completed jobs. 
  c. `To create a new job, click New Item. The People section lists users, while Manage Jenkins provides access to core configurations, plugin management, and system settings.
  d. To modify Number of executors - Dashboard > Managed > node > Configure
  e. myview: where can check the views of different project
  f. On the Jenkins dashboard you can see your job status. Whoch job success, last success count and time, failed etc.

-------------------------------------------
Create and Build First Job
-------------------------------------------
1. First job to run "Hello world" string.
Click New Item in Jenkins.
Enter a name for the job.
Select Freestyle project.
Go to the Build section.
Add an execute shell/steps command: echo "Hello World".
Click Build to run the job.
Open Console Output to check the result.

2. Same as Second job
whoami
pwd
cat /etc/hosts
tail /etc/passwd
ls -l

3. Create demo3 jobs
Run job with success for 5 times
Then failed job for 2 times then check job status.

4. jenkins Search bar
Use the search bar in Jenkins to find a job by its name. Ex. demo1 or demo2
Searching demo1 13 or demo2 3 takes you directly to that specific build.
Searching demo1 13 console opens the console output of that build.
Searching demo1 last failed build navigates to the most recent failed build of that job.

5. For giving job name: try to assign proper job naming convention:
testproject-build
testproject-test
testproject-deploy
testproject-deployprod

6. What is Plugins: A plugin is a software component that adds specific functionality to an existing computer program or web browser.
Plugins are designed to extend the capabilities of the host application without requiring any changes to its core code.

Suppose add theme: simple theme and restart (from managed jenkins)
Suppose install plugin from URL: managed jenkins > https://cdn.rawgit.com/afonsof/jenkins-material-theme/gh-pages/dist/material-{{your-color-name}}.css

7. User Management
Go to Manage Jenkins → Users.
Click Create User and fill in the details.
Test login with the newly created account.
By default, new users have full access, which is not recommended. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) should be applied to restrict permissions.

8. RBAC Setup
Log in as admin.
Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins and install Role-based Authorization Strategy.
Navigate to Manage Jenkins → Configure Global Security → Authorization → Role-Based Strategy and apply/save.
Log in as the newly created user to verify restricted access.
Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles to create roles and assign them to users.

Example Task:
Assign Project1 user the permission to create 4 jobs.
Assign Project2 user the permission to execute those jobs only.

9. Environment Variable
Definition: Environment variables in Jenkins are
key-value pairs used to store information that can be accessed by jobs during execution. Notes: - Create
job and set variables:
NAME=gklodh
echo "My name is ${NAME}"
ROLL=2
echo $ROLL

Create job to access those variable.

- Jenkins provides default environment variables visible in each job console. How to enable: In a job, go
to Configure → Build Environment → Use environment variables.

There have Jenkins default variable which can be seen by clicking on See the list of available environment variables. But this will change by project by project.

10. Global Variables
Definition: Variables accessible across all Jenkins jobs for consistency. Notes: - Example: GLOBAL_VAR
can be defined and used in any job. How to enable: Manage Jenkins → System → Global properties
→ Environment variables. Add key-value pairs.

Create job to access those variable.

11. Parameterized / User Input Variables
Definition: Variables that users provide input for before a job runs. Notes: - Types: Boolean, Choice,
Credentials, File, Multi-line String, Password, Run, String. - Example: File parameter allows uploading a
file and using it: cat $filePath . How to enable: Job → Configure → This project is parameterized
→ Add parameter.

Boolean Parameter
Choice Parameter
Credentials Parameter
File Parameter
Multi-line String Parameter
Password Parameter
Run Parameter
String Parameter

Check file parameter, password parameter
click on filepath and give variable such as filePath

12. Jenkins Timeout
Definition: Maximum duration a job is allowed to run. Notes: - Example: sleep 100 with timeout 1
minute. How to enable: Job → Configure → Build Environment → Terminate build if stuck .
Optionally mark build as failed.

Note: If want job became failed> Add action then Select failed

13. Jenkins Timestamp
Definition: Adds time info to console logs. Notes: Helpful for tracking execution duration of each step.
How to enable: Job → Configure → Build Environment → Add timestamps to console output.

execute job:
echo "hello"
sleep 3
echo "hello world"
after execute jobs check console output

14. Enable / Disable Jobs
Definition: Jobs can be temporarily disabled to prevent execution. Notes: Useful during maintenance
or development. How to enable/disable: Job → Configure → Disable project checkbox.

15. Concurrent / Parallel Builds
Definition: Allows multiple instances of a job to run simultaneously. Notes: Default is single execution.
How to enable: Job → Configure → General → Execute concurrent builds if necessary.
