Searching demo1 last failed build navigates to the most recent failed build of that job.

5. For giving job name: try to assign proper job naming convention:
testproject-build
testproject-test
testproject-deploy
testproject-deployprod

6. What is Plugins: A plugin is a software component that adds specific functionality to an existing computer program or web browser.
Plugins are designed to extend the capabilities of the host application without requiring any changes to its core code.

Suppose add theme: simple theme and restart (from managed jenkins)
Suppose install plugin from URL: managed jenkins > https://cdn.rawgit.com/afonsof/jenkins-material-theme/gh-pages/dist/material-{{your-color-name}}.css

7. User Management
Go to Manage Jenkins → Users.
Click Create User and fill in the details.
Test login with the newly created account.
By default, new users have full access, which is not recommended. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) should be applied to restrict permissions.

8. RBAC Setup
Log in as admin.
Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins and install Role-based Authorization Strategy.
Navigate to Manage Jenkins → Configure Global Security → Authorization → Role-Based Strategy and apply/save.
Log in as the newly created user to verify restricted access.
Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles to create roles and assign them to users.

Example Task:
Assign Project1 user the permission to create 4 jobs.
Assign Project2 user the permission to execute those jobs only.
